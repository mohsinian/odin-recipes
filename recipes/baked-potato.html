    <p><h2>Ingredients: </h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large sweet potato</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
        <li>Toppings</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheddar Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p><h2>Steps: </h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Scrub your potato under running water, prick it with a fork, then place it on a microwave-safe plate.</li>
        <li>Microwave for about 5 minutes, flip it over, and microwave it for about 5 more minutes. Let the potato cool for just a few minutes, until it's safe to handle. Cut the potato lengthwise so that it opens and forms a natural bowl.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then mash the inside with a fork. Top with butter and Cheddar, then return to the microwave to melt the cheese. Finish it with sour cream and the toppings of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
